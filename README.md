    • Things to look into: 
        ◦ What personality measures correspond to drug use? 
        ◦ What types of drugs and what combinations of personalities? 
        ◦ What are typical use pattens? 
            ▪ People smoke weed every day, they never do psychedelics 
        ◦ Categorize into..	
            ▪ Stims 
            ▪ Psychs 
            ▪ Downers 
        ◦ Are people who take psychedelics more open to experience? 
        ◦ Do I have enough data points to look at people who dont do caffeine? 
        ◦ Take 538 dataset and multiply it by David Nutt drug impact ratings on society 
            ▪ What drugs are wholesomely the WORST for society? 
        ◦ Hypothesis Testing: 
            ▪ Impulsiveness Vs Heroin
                • Does your degree of impulsiveness affect your heroin usage? Are they correlated? 
                    ◦ Ho: Impulsivity does not correlate to heroin usage
                    ◦ Ha: Impulsivity does correlate to heroin usage 
                • Does your degree of impulsiveness affect your heroin usage? Are they correlated? 
                    ◦ Ho: Impulsivity does not correlate to heroin usage
                    ◦ Ha: Impulsivity does correlate to heroin usage 
                • Extraversion/Introversion vs Alcohol? 
                • Openness to Experience with LSD and Mushrooms? 
                • Given that they take Amyls, what is the most likely drug that they also take? 
                • Given that you take LSD, what other drugs are you most likely to take?

    • Big Questions:
        ◦ Many drug problems exist quietly in society and we never know they go on unless we see somebody we know with the habit.  
            ▪ Understanding that people smoke weed every day
            ▪ People do not do psychedelics every day
            ▪ Caffeine, Alcohol, Chocolate being used ALL of the time 
            ▪ Mushroom, LSD, Ketamine being used more and more 
            ▪ Openness and psychedelics 
            ▪ 

    • Neuroticism 
    • Openness to Experience 
    • Agreeableness 
    • Consientiousness 
    • Extraversion 
    • Impulsivity 
    • Sensation Seeking 
    • Level of education
    • Age 
    • Gender 
    • Country? 
    • 
    • Vs drugs 
    • 
    • Alcohol and neuroticism 
    • Cannabis reduces neuroticism
    • Psychedelics and Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness 
    • Sensation Seeking for Weird Ass Drugs 
    • Level of Education 
    • 
    • Numericize everything
    • 
    • 
    • Drank in the past day vs neuroticism
    • Ever done ketamine/amyls vs sensation seeking 
    • 
    • 
    • Groupby “Has done cocaine in the past day” 
        ◦ Then see avg personality measures and the variacne of those measures 
        ◦ Then perhaps bootstrap and do hypothesis testing 
    • 
    • 
    • Filter for just people who have done psychs in the past ten years? 
        ◦ Find the mean opennness 
        ◦ Compare that that to the pop
        ◦ H0: no different 
        ◦ Ha: they are more open 
        ◦ Give similar weight to these things… 
            ▪ A year? More stringent cutoff 
            ▪ If it was a small subset I would need to bootstrap 
            ▪
