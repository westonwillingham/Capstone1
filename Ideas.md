    • Capstone 1 Datasets 
            ▪ How does the United States compare to other nations with COVID-19 vaccinations? 
                • COVID-19 vaccination rates https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/covid-world-vaccination-progress
                    ◦ Note: this includes time series data.  This isn’t the idea of the project. While a graph of various countries vaccinating over time is interesting, the goal of this project is to look at how the US compares to other leaders in global health. How bad is the United States at vaccinating people? How have other large countries done? Does the count of doctors in the country correlate to vaccination rates? 
                    ◦ Normalizing for health infrastructure (hospital beds per capita, doctors per capita, etc) who has done the worst at vaccinating people? 
            ▪ Drug use 
                • Which population groups use which drugs the most? 
                    ◦ https://www.samhsa.gov/data/data-we-collect/nsduh-national-survey-drug-use-and-health
                    ◦ https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/fivethirtyeight-drug-use-by-age-dataset
                • Where are opiates a problem in the United States? 
                    ◦ https://www.kaggle.com/apryor6/us-opiate-prescriptions
                    ◦ Are opiate prescriptions causing opiate overdoses? Or are the OD’s from heroin and aren’t related?

                    This dataset shows drug use and people's tendencies 
                    
            ▪ Cancer vs Animal Product Consumption
                • https://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5I-X/Pages/download.aspx
                • Which countries/groups of people have the highest cancer rates and what is this correlated to? 
                • Can I hypothesis test that less meat eating groups experience less cancer with certainty? 
                • I can map people throughout the world 
                • I can compare wealth factors from other datasets, as most meat consumption is correlated to wealth 
                    ◦ What other factors are correlated to wealth? 
                • I could narrow this to red meat consumption 
                • The Seven Country Study dataset is important too
